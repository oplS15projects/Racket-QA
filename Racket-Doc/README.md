###**Racket-Doc**

####**Project Description**
A documentation generator for the Racket language.  It will extract documentation and specified attributes from source files and generate code for a web server and web pages, with the extracted data imbeded.  The web server is by default running on the local host; however, this can easily be modified by changing a single line in the output source file.

####**Second Milestone**
Due to the infinite possible variety, I suggest that you use one of the test files provided.  You are of course welcome to attempt to run your own file, but make sure to follow the current **required** guidelines and limitations of the system.  I will make the program more flexable by the final release.

####**Preparation**
To write documentation to be analyzed and generated by the application you must use the following syntax, which experienced programmers will recognize as similar to traditional JavaDoc.
```scheme
#||
 |This procedure does so-and-so
 |
 |@param num This is a number which will have
 |	     something...
 |@return Returns #t if ... else #f
 |#
(define (name-of-proc num)
.
.
.
```
**Note**:Since this program is still under construction, it is currently rather picky about several characteristics which I intend to fix before the final release:
- There should be a one-to-one ratio between procedures/global variables and documentation; i.e. **every** precedure and global variable should have documentation.  Any which do not will be ignored.
- Global variables **cannot** be defined on one line.  The should be defined in over two lines--for example:
```scheme
(define five
     5)
```
- **Do not** put other comments *on there own line*.  For example,
```scheme
(+ 2 4) ;;this adds two numbers
```
is **ok**, but
```scheme
;;this adds two numbers
(+ 2 4)
```
is **not ok**.


####**Build & Run**

**Optional**:
This package includes a css file if you would like more elegent web pages to
be generated.  If so, copy and past the directory **httdocs** *(found in Racket-QA/Racket-Doc/ )*
into one of your output destinations *(see below)*.

**Required**:
Run "MainGui.rkt".  Select a *.rkt source file or directory.
Select an output destination.
The output will be stored to in the location in a file named ```racketDocOutput.rkt```.
Run this file.
